  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:

  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests

  #
  # An example Puppet manifest to provision the message of the day:
  #
  # # group { "puppet":
  # #   ensure => "present",
  # # }

  # # File { owner => 0, group => 0, mode => 0644 }
